      "\n",
      "REFLECTION\n",
      "\n",
      " Here are some critiques and recommendations for your Merge Sort implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Return Value**: The function `merge_sort` should not return the array at the end. Merge Sort is typically an in-place sorting algorithm with the sorted results available in the original array. Instead, you should simply perform the sorting without returning the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Function Clarity**: Although your implementation is clear, adding comments to explain key steps of the algorithm, such as what is happening at each merge step, could enhance readability for others less familiar with the algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Performance Optimization**: Although the current implementation works correctly, the auxiliary space used for the left and right halves (`L` and `R`) could be minimized by passing indices to slices instead of creating new lists. This would reduce the memory overhead of your implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Type Hints**: Consider adding type hints to your function signature. This would provide clarity to anyone reading or using your function. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def merge_sort(arr: List[int]) -> None:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   (Don't forget to import `List` from the `typing` module.)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Edge Cases Handling**: Although the base case is correctly implemented, you might want to explicitly handle edge cases, such as when the input array is empty. You could add an initial check to return early if `arr` is empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Testing**: While you've included a sample usage, consider adding more test cases, especially edge cases like already sorted arrays, arrays with duplicate values, and very large arrays to confirm that your implementation works in all scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Code Structure**: As a stylistic choice, the formatting of your code could be improved for better readability—for example, adding a line break between logical sections (e.g., before the merging step).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a slightly modified version based on some of these recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "from typing import List\n",
